# Knight's Dialer kata

This is a ruby kata based in this article:
 https://alexgolec.dev/google-interview-questions-deconstructed-the-knights-dialer/

## Kata:
"Imagine you place a knight chess piece on a phone dial pad. This chess piece moves in an uppercase “L” shape: two steps horizontally followed by one vertically, or one step horizontally then two vertically

Suppose you dial keys on the keypad using only hops a knight can make. Every time the knight lands on a key, we dial that key and make another hop. The starting position counts as being dialed.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in N hops from a particular starting position?"

## Test
In order to run the tests, we have to execute this command: rspec

The tests run randomly.

## To improve
Currently in my machine, this code only works for 12 hops, after that it cannot handle the all different iterations.
